## Planning for Success - My Personal Roadmap

The CS50W course aims to teach full-stack web development, covering a wide range of topics that provide a solid foundation for building modern web applications. This is the main course that I have taken.

Harvard University also offers other Computer Science courses, including a Python course and a SQL course, which are aligned with Web Programming. I have taken these as supplementary courses as well.
